# Fibonacci Meets Quantum Computing
The Fibonacci Quantum Error Correction Scheme repository is an open-source initiative designed to enhance quantum error correction for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Leveraging principles of logical teleportation and recursive encoding, this project offers a practical and scalable solution to mitigate quantum computational errors. By integrating cutting-edge methodologies such as Multi-Level Splitting, Cross-Entropy optimization, and Bayesian inference, it provides a robust framework for analyzing and improving error correction under diverse noise conditions.

This implementation supports various noise models, including depolarizing, dephasing, and Pauli errors, ensuring adaptability to different quantum environments. Built using Qiskitâ€™s stabilizer formalism, the project enables efficient simulation and benchmarking of the Fibonacci scheme. With a modular design and detailed documentation, the repository is accessible to researchers, educators, and enthusiasts, lowering the barriers to entry in quantum error correction research.

The Fibonacci scheme demonstrates significant reductions in logical error rates, even under challenging noise scenarios, making it a critical tool for advancing NISQ-era quantum technologies. It combines advanced quantum techniques with scalable classical error correction methods, such as Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, to optimize performance while maintaining resource efficiency. This hybrid approach positions the Fibonacci scheme as a vital component in the journey toward fault-tolerant quantum computing.

By making this framework open source, the project fosters collaboration and innovation within the global quantum research community. It supports critical applications in quantum cryptography, molecular simulation, and optimization, enabling NISQ devices to address complex problems with improved stability and accuracy. This repository invites the community to explore, refine, and expand upon the Fibonacci scheme, accelerating progress toward reliable and practical quantum computation. Join us in shaping the future of quantum technologies through this accessible and transformative initiative.
